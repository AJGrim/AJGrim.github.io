This repository contains the source code for my personal website nd online portfolio.
The site is designed to showcase who I am, a Mechanical Engineer with a concentration in Aerospac, and to highlight my professional work, academic experience, and personal projects in a clean, responsive format.

This portfolio serves as:
- A central hub to dispaly my engineering background and project summaries.
- A place to experiment with web design and front-end development at a surface level.
- A dynamic resume that links my personal and professional profiles for an easy form of contact.
